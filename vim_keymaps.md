# Some key mappings available

* Note that the leader key is set to space key instead of the default backslash.
* Keys in square brackets mean those keys should be combined independently with the other key, for example `<leader>[w/q]` means `<leader>w` or `<leader>q`.
* It is case sensitive (i.e. `J` means `<shift-j>`)
* There are some automatically configured settings that is not mentioned here, such as the Tabular for auto-formatting tables that use `|` and `&`.
